- **M1:** Single-camera lane + object overlay, HMI metrics panel.  
- **M2:** Multi-camera ingest via FPD-Link IV, synchronized timestamps.  
- **M3:** Blind-spot and gap-assessment FSM with radar fusion.  
- **M4:** 360° birdseye calibration and real-time stitching.  
- **M5:** Voice UX with LLM/STT/TTS and navigation + media tool calls.  
- **M6:** Predictive suspension prototype (ToF/Stereo → MCU feed-forward).  

Each milestone includes logging, replay, latency profiling, and thermal validation.
